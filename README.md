Welcome to the AirBnB clone project.
First step write a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.
A command interpreter is like a shell but limited to a specific use case. We want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
=> Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
=> Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
=> Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
=> Update attributes of an object
=> Destroy an object
